# Algorithms
In this segment, I upload codes for questions on Hackerrank or any other coding websites that i find exciting.
The codes are written in such a way that it passes all the testcases of the question.
All the codes here are of my own logic and written by me.
If you have a better and easy way of solving the questions, feel free to commint changes.
Thank you :)
